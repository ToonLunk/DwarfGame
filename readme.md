# Dwarf Game

## Overview

Dwarf Game is a massively multiplayer game you play in your browser. Team up with your friends or make new friends and form alliances, make enemies, and conquer territories in this free-to-play browser-based game.

## Gameplay

**Fighting**: Players can do battle with different types of dwarves in their companies – ranging from small scouts who come in large numbers to massive dwarves equipped with high-tech mechanical armor. Prepare your strategy and play both defense and offense.

**Teamwork and Rivalry**: Dwarves who work together are more efficient! If you prefer the lonesome contractor life, then so be it – but some dwarves prefer company among others and will choose to ally themselves together. Share secrets, strategies, resources, and fighting power by joining an alliance. Be the compassionate leader you always wanted to be, or maybe take charge or your alliance’s fighting division!

**Upgrading**: Players start out with level 1 buildings and technologies (things like time to create dwarves, dwarf fighting power, etc). To get your company up and going strong, you can do the righteous thing and mine them yourself, or you can call all-out war on other players and alliances to take theirs for yourself…

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: TypeScript (Angular) with SCSS
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
    Last time I started this project, I used NodeJS and Express. Since then, I've grown accustomed to Angular a little more and find it easier to work with. I chose FastAPI because Python is simple to write and FastAPI is very fast. I used PostgreSQL because it's the SQL flavor I'm used to.
